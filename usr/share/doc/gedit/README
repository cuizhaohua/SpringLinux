General Information
===================

This is version 3.14.0 of gedit. gedit is a small and lightweight UTF-8 text
editor for the GNOME environment.

gedit is part of GNOME and uses the latest GTK+ and GNOME libraries.
Complete GNOME integration is featured, with support for Drag and Drop (DnD) 
from Nautilus (the GNOME file manager), the use of the GNOME help system,
the GNOME Virtual File System and the GNOME print framework.

gedit uses a Multiple Document Interface (MDI), which lets you edit more than 
one document at the same time.

gedit supports most standard editing features, plus several not found in your 
average text editor (plugins being the most notable of these).

The gedit core is written in the C language. Thanks to GObject introspection,
plugins may also be written in other languages, like Vala and Python.

Although new features are always under development, currently gedit has:

    * Complete support for UTF-8 text
    * Syntax highlighting
    * Support for editing remote files
    * Search and replace
    * Printing and Print Previewing Support
    * File Revert
    * A complete preferences interface
    * Configurable Plugin system, with optional python support


Some of the plugins, packaged and installed with gedit include, among others:

    * Word count
    * Spell checker
    * File Browser
    * Automatic snippet expansion
    * Sort
    * Insert Date/Time
    * External Tools
    * Tag list

Other external plugins are also available.

How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system.
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product gedit). You will need to create an
account for yourself.

In the bug report please include:

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What version of gedit
   - What operating system and version
   - What version of the gtk+, glib and gnome libraries

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occurred.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
  necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error,
  it will be more useful if the stack trace is produced running the test
  program with the --sync command line option.


Patches
=======

Patches should also be submitted to bugzilla.gnome.org. If the patch
fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment to that bug
report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the patch, and attach
the patch to that bug report.

Please create patches with the git format-patch command.
