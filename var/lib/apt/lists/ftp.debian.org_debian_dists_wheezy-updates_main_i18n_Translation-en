Package: clamav
Description-md5: 25816a2f56a0c214a484e117fd9fe0b1
Description-en: anti-virus utility for Unix - command-line interface
 Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose of
 this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
 scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable
 multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a command-line
 scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via
 the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The programs are based
 on libclamav6, which can be used by other software.
 .
 This package contains the command line interface. Features:
  - built-in support for various archive formats, including Zip, Tar,
    Gzip, Bzip2, OLE2, Cabinet, CHM, BinHex, SIS and others;
  - built-in support for almost all mail file formats;
  - built-in support for ELF executables and Portable Executable files
    compressed with UPX, FSG, Petite, NsPack, wwpack32, MEW, Upack and
    obfuscated with SUE, Y0da Cryptor and others;
  - built-in support for popular document formats including Microsoft
    Office and Mac Office files, HTML, RTF and PDF.
 .
 For scanning to work, a virus database is needed. There are two options
 for getting it:
  - clamav-freshclam: updates the database from Internet. This is
    recommended with Internet access.
  - clamav-data: for users without Internet access. The package is
    not updated once installed. The clamav-getfiles package allows
    creating custom packages from an Internet-connected computer.

Package: policyd-weight
Description-md5: b49f51c6147d3c38b7e7ac0a66df6758
Description-en: Perl policy daemon for the Postfix MTA
 policyd-weight is intended to eliminate forged envelope senders and HELOs
 (i.e. in bogus mails). It allows you to score DNSBLs (RBL/RHSBL), HELO,
 MAIL FROM and client IP addresses before any queuing is done. It allows
 you to REJECT messages which have a score higher than allowed, providing
 improved blocking of spam and virus mails. policyd-weight caches the most
 frequent client/sender combinations (SPAM as well as HAM) to reduce the
 number of DNS queries.

Package: spamassassin
Description-md5: dc09f4668ebbf8e10ef779ed26e5716c
Description-en: Perl-based spam filter using text analysis
 SpamAssassin is a very powerful and fully configurable spam filter
 with numerous features including automatic white-listing, RBL
 testing, Bayesian analysis, header and body text analysis. It is
 designed to be called from a user's .procmail or .forward file, but
 can also be integrated into a Mail Transport Agent (MTA).
 .
 Included in this package is a daemonized form of spamassassin (spamd)
 which communicates with its client (spamc) via TCP, to reduce the
 overhead of loading perl with each message. To take advantage of
 this, you must install the spamc package.

Description-en: Client for SpamAssassin spam filtering daemon
 spamc is the client to communicate with spamd, the daemonized form of
 SpamAssassin (see the spamassassin package). It is written in C for
 maximum speed and minimum loading overhead.
 .
 spamc is quite useful for integrating spamassassin into an MTA or
 into a .procmailrc file because of its speed.
 .
 This package is useless unless you have spamassassin installed,
 either on this machine or another local machine (i.e. a mail server).
